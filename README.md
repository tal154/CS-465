## Architecture

In this project I utilized HTML & JavaScript using Express and Angular as my frontend architectures. On my customer facing side, I used HTML documents with JavaScript to display data served by Express. Multiple pages were loaded one at a time per user request via MVC architecture. Angular was used on the administration facing side. Using Angular, I created multiple components that were loaded programatically within the same HTML document. Single page applications, or SPAs, were used to allow admins seamless transitions to navigate the site. This is done by preloading all the documents so the code was already available. This is opposed to having to loading and caching a new page everytime. On the backend, I utilized MongoDB, a NoSQL database, because it works well with Node.JS. An advantage of using MongoDB is it scales well and there are less transformations needed to be done for storing or retriving data for use.
